Harvard's  policy since  1970  (after the damage caused by  Love Story) has  been to permit filming on its property only rarely, so most scenes  set at  Harvard  (especially  indoor shots,  but excepting aerial footage  and shots of public  areas  such as  Harvard Square)  are in  fact shot  elsewhere.
